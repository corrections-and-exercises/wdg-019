<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>In this exercise, you will learn how to render lists of data! Not only that, you'll have a closer look a React's data flow.</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Given the exisiting <code>students</code> array, render the <code>Student</code> component as many times as you need.
<ul>
<li>There is a caveat: You will need to pass data to your component from within the <code>map</code> loop! How? Well, remember your component is nothing but a function,<a href="https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> you can pass arguments to your component by declaring props&nbsp;</a></li>
<li>Apply the necessary adjustments to the <code>Student</code> and <code>Grade</code> components so they take a <code>student</code>and <code>gpa</code> property respectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't forget about the <code>key</code> property!</li>
<li>Add additional styles so the cards look tidy together</li>
</ul>
